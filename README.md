# Density Perception (Master research project)
<ul>
  <li> Implemented applications with PsychoPy to produce visual stimuli for performing visual perception experiments and collecting data to build computational models </li>
  <li> Simulated humans’ estimate of density/number of objects using Spatial Frequency filters and Image Occupancy models </li>
</ul>
